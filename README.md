# Advent of Code in Rust

A general dumping ground for all future Advent of Code challenges I feel like working on.

Solutions can be run by doing the following:

    $ aoc 2018 day1 < input/2018/day1
    part1: 490
    part2: 70357

Alternatively, you can also run them via `cargo`:

    $ cargo run 2018 day1 < input/2018/day1
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.55s
        Running `target\debug\aoc.exe 2018 day1`
    part1: 490
    part2: 70357
